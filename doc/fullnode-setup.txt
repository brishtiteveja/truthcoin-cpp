Hivemind fullnode setup guide

Tested on / recommended: Debian stable x64
================================================================================

1.
First of all you need to setup the server that you are going to run the
hivemind node on. This guide will assume that you have either direct access to
the terminal or SSH access.

2.
Make sure that you have updated the system completely:
  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

 and then reboot the system:
  reboot

3.
Create a non-privileged user who will run the full node, do not use any default
root account that your VPS provider configures.
  adduser hivemind
You will be asked to enter a password twice, you can skip the full name and all
other optional information.

4.
(Skip to step 7 if you are downloading pre-built binaries)
Install required dependencies if you are going to build from source, skip this
step if you will be downloading the pre-built binaries:
  apt-get install \
    git \
    build-essential \
    autoconf \
    pkg-config \
    libboost-all-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    libtool \
    libdb++-dev

and then reboot the system:
  reboot

5.
Download source code, skip this step if you will be downloading the pre-built
binaries:
  git clone https://github.com:/bitcoin-hivemind/hivemind

6.
Compile the source code, skip this step if you will be downloading the pre-built
binaries:
  cd hivemind
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-incompatible-bdb
  make

  Note: add the -j switch to make in order to speed up compilation. For example
  on an 8 core system, make -j 9 will use all 8 cores, or make -j 5 will use
  half of them. You can also specify simply make -j and make will guess how
  many threads to use, this can cause lockups so beware.

  Warning: You may need to enable and configure swapfiles if your computer or
  VPS has a small amount of memory available (<2 GB)

  How to enable and configure swapfiles (create 1.1 GB swapfile at /swapfile):
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=64M count=16
    chmod 600 /swapfile
    mkswap /swapfile
    swapon /swapfile

7.
(Skip to step 8 if you built from source)
Download and extract the pre-built hivemind binary for your platform
  wget http://forum.truthcoin.info/Builds/hivemind-0.10.99-linux64.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf hivemind-0.10.99-linux64.tar.gz

8.
Setup your configuration file, all of the same options are available in
hivemind that are in Bitcoin. An rpc password is required.

Example configuration file located at ~/.hivemind/hivemind.conf:
  rpcuser=hivemindrpc
  rpcpassword=EuCCV1xGaZffjre6oaDFwL5uqPF2m7E3Be1VXvr3zZ

9.
Run the hivemindd binary as the non-privileged user we created earlier
  ./hivemindd &

  Tip: Adding the ampersand & symbol after a command in Linux will make it run
  in the background so you still control the active terminal. (useful for ssh)

10.
To test the connection to the full node, run the following command from the
debug window of the qt client:
  addpeer ***.***.***.*** onetry

Then, check the peer list in the debug menu to make sure you can connect to the
full node you have created.
